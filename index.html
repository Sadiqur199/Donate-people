      <h2>Food For a Family</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="paragrah">Nutrient deficiencies and illnesses during this period contribute globally to higher rates of undernutrition among children under five. Many parents are inadequately informed about when and how to feed their children complementary food alongside breastfeeding â€” when to start, frequency and minimum dietary diversity.</p>

      <h2>Education For a child</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="paragrah">Education is the birthright of every child. There are many reasons why education is vital for children. It develops wisdom and intelligence which help in being self-dependent in life. It plays a vital role in the development of personality. It develops confidence also and helps us to become a responsible citizen of the nation.</p>
